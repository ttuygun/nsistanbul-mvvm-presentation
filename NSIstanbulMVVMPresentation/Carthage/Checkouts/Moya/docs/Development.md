# Development

## Testing

To run tests locally, you will need to download Moya's dependencies.
To do so, run `carthage update --platform iOS` and take a nap, waiting for it to
finish. ðŸ˜´

If you don't have Carthage installed, check the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage).
And, of course, don't forget to run `carthage update --platform iOS` after.

Afer that, you can open `Moya.xcodeproj` and hit âŒ˜+U to start testing.
